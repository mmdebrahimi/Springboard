# SPRINGBOARD Projects
Hello and welcome to my github page. feel free to use my code. If there are any projects that you would like to collaborate in, please do send me a message.

Springboard is an online coding school offering online, flexible, mentor-led courses including the Data Science Career Track, UX Design Career Track, and Machine Learning Career Track (all offer job guarantees). While learning cutting-edge digital skills entirely online, students receive teaching and mentorship from industry experts. Springboard offers a number of self-paced, mentor-led workshops, plus a full Data Science Career Track program. The Data Science Career Track includes a deferred tuition option, so students can enroll for a small deposit and finish paying after starting a job. In all of Springboardâ€™s self-paced courses, students develop job-ready skills that display industry-worthy capstone and portfolio projects. Throughout the entire process, students receive support from their industry mentor, as well as Springboard's resident advisors and the larger student/alumni community. Springboard combines expert-curated curricula with one-on-one mentorship. Springboard has served thousands of students from around the world.

The Major Capstone projects are designed to give participants a platform to implement their skills in problems of their choosing with guidance from in-depth knowledge of mentors who are in the industry

I am very interested and enthusiastic about the upcoming revolutionary wave of Artificial Intelligence which I beilieve will be helping humans in every aspect of any job that does not require high levels of creativity. Wether it be in engineering, sciences, finance or even arts, Artificial Intelligence can improve the way we interact with the job at hand by many orders of magnitude and give us access to tools that were thought to be impossible when they could only be done by humans.
